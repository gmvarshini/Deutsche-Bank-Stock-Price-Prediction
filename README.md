# Stock Price Analysis and Prediction of Deutsche Bank using LSTM

This project aims to analyze the stock prices of Deutsche Bank for EQUITY markets in New York, Germany, and France. The project involves collecting historical stock prices data from these markets, analyzing the trends and patterns using various statistical and technical indicators, and developing a predictive model using LSTM to predict the close price of EQUITY-Germany.

# The project involves the following steps:

# 1. Data Collection:
Historical stock prices data is collected for Deutsche Bank from EQUITY markets in New York, Germany, and France using various data sources such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, etc.

# 2. Data Preprocessing:
The collected data is preprocessed to remove any missing values, anomalies, and outliers. The data is also scaled to a common range to ensure comparability between different markets.

# 3. Data Analysis:
The preprocessed data is analyzed using various statistical and technical indicators such as moving averages to identify trends and patterns in the data.

# 4. LSTM Model Development:
An LSTM model is developed using the preprocessed data to predict the close price of EQUITY-Germany. The model is trained using a portion of the data and validated using the remaining portion.

# 5. Model Evaluation:
The developed model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.


The final output of this project is a predictive model that can be used to forecast the close price of EQUITY-Germany based on historical stock prices data. The project also provides insights into the trends and patterns in the stock prices of Deutsche Bank across differentÂ markets.
